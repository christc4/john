Here's a comforting thought from Orthodox priest Father Lawrence Farley:

"The pastoral irony of all this, of course, is that any Christian who asks a priest with trembling whether or not he has committed the unforgivable sin cannot possibly have committed it, for the question proves that the one asking it loves Jesus and fears being separate from Him.  Let such devout souls fear nothing.  They have clearly been caught in the fishermenâ€™s net, along with other fish.  Let them persevere in their devotion, and rest assured of final forgiveness."
