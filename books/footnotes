\textit{\textbf{St. Basil the Great, Hexameron}} - ``The beginning, in effect, is indivisible and instantaneous. The beginning of the road is not yet the road, and that of the house is not yet the house; so the beginning of time is not yet time and not even the least particle of it. If some objector tell us that the beginning is a time, he ought then, as he knows well, to submit it to the division of time — a beginning, a middle and an end. Now it is ridiculous to imagine a beginning of a beginning. Further, if we divide the beginning into two, we make two instead of one, or rather make several, we really make an infinity, for all that which is divided is divisible to the infinite...''\\
\textit{\textbf{St. John Chrysostom, Homily 2}} - ``For the intellect, having ascended to \textit{``the beginning''}, enquires what \textit{``beginning''}; and then finding the \textit{``was''} always outstripping its imagination, has no point at which to stay its thought; but looking intently onwards, and being unable to cease at any point, it becomes wearied out, and turns back to things below. For this \textit{``was in the beginning,''} is nothing else than expressive of ever being and being infinitely.''\\
\textit{\textbf{St. Cyril of Alexandria, Homily 2}} - ``Than \textit{``the beginning''} is there nothing older, if it have, retained to itself, the definition of the beginning (for a beginning of beginning there cannot be); or it will wholly depart from being in truth a beginning, if something else be imagined before it and arise before it. Otherwise, if anything can precede what is truly beginning, our language respecting it will go off to infinity, another beginning ever cropping up before, and making second the one under investigation.
There will then be no beginning of beginning, according to exact and true reasoning, but the account of it will recede unto the long-extended and incomprehensive. And since its ever-backward flight has no terminus, and reaches up to the limit of the ages, the Son will be found to have been not made in time, but rather invisibly existing with the Father: for in the beginning was He. But if He was in the beginning, what mind, tell me, can over-leap the force of the was? When will the was stay as at its terminus, seeing that it ever runs before the pursuing reasoning, and springs forward before the conception that follows it?
\textbf{Warning:} JW's will twist this and say ``The beginning'' refers to the time when God began his creative work and produced the Word. Orthodox believe the Word sprung forth eternally from the Father.}
