Here's a comforting thought from Orthodox priest Father Lawrence Farley:

"The pastoral irony of all this, of course, is that any Christian who asks a priest with trembling whether or not he has committed the unforgivable sin cannot possibly have committed it, for the question proves that the one asking it loves Jesus and fears being separate from Him.  Let such devout souls fear nothing.  They have clearly been caught in the fishermen’s net, along with other fish.  Let them persevere in their devotion, and rest assured of final forgiveness."

Polysemy of logos in Greek is staggering, approach its general meaning
precisely the principle behind Polysemy in a deductive mannar,
logos is the mode by which everything that "is" becomes manifest, becomes "known"
logos signifes every referential activity that manifests as otherness, as such the primary meaning of logos is disclosure
